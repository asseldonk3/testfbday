# AI Day Trading System - Opportunity Solution Tree

## Core Problem Statement
Day traders need to process vast amounts of unstructured information in real-time to identify profitable trading opportunities, but human cognitive limits prevent effective analysis of all available data sources simultaneously.

## Root Opportunity
**Leverage AI/LLM capabilities to create an information processing edge in day trading**

### Sub-Opportunities

- B. Single monolithic LLM processing all information
- C. Rule-based keyword matching system

#### 2. Gap Trading with Narrative Validation
**Problem**: Many gap trades fail due to weak catalysts
**Solutions Explored**:
- A. AI qualifier that scores gap quality based on news catalyst ✅ **SELECTED**
- B. Pure technical analysis of gap patterns
- C. Manual review of overnight news

#### 3. Social Momentum Detection
**Problem**: Social-driven moves happen too fast for manual detection
**Solutions Explored**:
- A. Velocity-based sentiment analysis with multi-source monitoring ✅ **SELECTED**
- B. Simple sentiment scoring
- C. Volume-only momentum detection

## Risk Mitigation Framework

### Technical Risks
- **API rate limits**: Implement caching and request pooling
- **LLM hallucinations**: Cross-validate signals with multiple models
- **Execution latency**: Use direct market access APIs

### Market Risks
- **False signals**: Implement confidence thresholds
- **Slippage**: Start with liquid, large-cap stocks
- **Black swan events**: Hard stop losses and daily loss limits

### Operational Risks
- **System failures**: Redundant infrastructure, kill switches
- **Regulatory compliance**: Trade only public information
- **Capital preservation**: Risk 1% per trade maximum
