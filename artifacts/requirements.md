# AI Day Trading System - Technical Requirements & Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
Build an AI-powered day trading system leveraging LLM agents for real-time information processing across news, social media, and market data to execute three core strategies: News-Based Trading, Gap and Go, and Momentum Scalping.

## Core User Stories

### Epic 1: News-Based Trading System
**As a** day trader  
**I want** an AI system that monitors and analyzes breaking news in real-time  
**So that** I can trade on material information before the broader market reacts

#### User Story 1.1: News Monitoring
- **Given** multiple news sources are configured (NewsAPI, Bloomberg, SEC EDGAR)
- **When** new content is published containing tracked ticker symbols
- **Then** the system captures and queues it for analysis within 5 seconds

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Monitors at minimum 10 news sources simultaneously
- Filters for S&P 500 ticker mentions
- Deduplicates similar stories
- Maintains 99% uptime during market hours

#### User Story 1.2: News Analysis & Scoring
- **Given** a news article about a tracked company
- **When** the LLM analyzes the content
- **Then** it produces sentiment score, materiality rating, and trade recommendation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Sentiment classification accuracy >85%
- Materiality score on 1-10 scale
- Processing time <15 seconds per article
- Explanation of reasoning provided

#### User Story 1.3: Trade Execution
- **Given** a high-confidence trading signal from news analysis
- **When** risk parameters are met
- **Then** the system executes the trade automatically

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Position sizing based on Kelly Criterion
- Stop loss set at 2% below entry
- Take profit at 2x risk (4% gain)
- Maximum 3 concurrent positions

### Epic 2: Gap and Go Strategy
**As a** day trader  
**I want** to identify and trade stocks gapping on strong catalysts  
**So that** I can capture continuation moves at market open

#### User Story 2.1: Overnight Analysis
- **Given** market close at 4 PM EST
- **When** running overnight until 9:30 AM EST
- **Then** system identifies all material news for tracked stocks

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Processes all earnings releases
- Captures analyst upgrades/downgrades
- Identifies M&A announcements
- Correlates news with pre-market price gaps

#### User Story 2.2: Gap Qualification
- **Given** a stock gapping >5% in pre-market
- **When** evaluated against overnight news
- **Then** assigns gap quality grade (A/B/C/F)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Grade A: Strong catalyst, likely to continue
- Grade B: Moderate catalyst, possible continuation
- Grade C: Weak catalyst, likely to fade
- Grade F: No catalyst found, avoid

#### User Story 2.3: Opening Bell Execution
- **Given** Grade A or B gap stock
- **When** breaks pre-market high on volume at open
- **Then** enters position with defined risk

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Entry only on volume confirmation (2x average)
- Stop loss below pre-market low
- Scale out 50% at 1R, remainder at 2R
- Exit all by 10:30 AM EST

### Epic 3: Social Momentum Detection
**As a** day trader  
**I want** to detect emerging social media momentum  
**So that** I can ride retail-driven price moves

#### User Story 3.1: Social Listening
- **Given** configured social media sources
- **When** monitoring in real-time
- **Then** detects unusual mention velocity

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Monitors Reddit (WSB, stocks, investing)
- Tracks Twitter/X finance influencers
- Monitors StockTwits trending
- Alerts on 3x normal mention rate

#### User Story 3.2: Velocity Analysis
- **Given** detected mention spike
- **When** analyzing sentiment and acceleration
- **Then** calculates momentum score

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Measures mention rate change (1st and 2nd derivative)
- Sentiment must be >70% positive
- Correlates with volume spike
- Generates score 0-100

#### User Story 3.3: Scalping Execution
- **Given** momentum score >80
- **When** technical entry confirmed
- **Then** executes scalp trade

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Position size 0.5% of capital
- 1-minute chart for entry
- Exit on momentum deceleration
- Maximum hold time 30 minutes

```

#### 3. Execution Engine
```python

    """Handles all trade execution"""
    
    def __init__(self, broker_api):
        self.broker = broker_api
        self.positions = {}

    def execute_signal(self, signal: TradingSignal):
        """Place orders based on signals"""
        
        if self.validate_risk(signal):
            order = self.create_order(signal)
            self.broker.submit_order(order)
            self.monitor_position(order.id)
    
    def create_bracket_order(self, signal):
        """Create order with stop loss and take profit"""
        
        return {
            'entry': signal.entry_price,
            'stop_loss': signal.entry_price * 0.98,
