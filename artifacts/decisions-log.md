# AI Day Trading System - Decision Log

## Strategic Decisions

### Decision 1: Strategy Selection
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Decision**: Selected News-Based Trading, Gap and Go, and Momentum Scalping as core strategies  
**Rationale**: 
- These strategies maximize LLM advantages in text processing
- Clear, automatable decision points
- Complementary approaches covering different market conditions
- Minimal reliance on complex technical analysis

**Alternatives Considered**:
- VWAP Trading: Rejected - purely technical, no LLM advantage
- Support/Resistance: Rejected - price action based, minimal narrative component
- Moving Average Crossovers: Rejected - basic technical indicator, no AI edge

### Decision 2: Multi-Agent Architecture
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Decision**: Implement specialized agents (Scout, Analyst, Executor) rather than monolithic system  
**Rationale**:
- Separation of concerns improves maintainability
- Allows parallel processing of different data streams
- Easier to debug and optimize individual components
- Can use different models for different tasks

**Trade-offs**:
- More complex coordination required
- Higher infrastructure costs
- Potential latency from inter-agent communication

### Decision 3: Technology Stack
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Decision**: Python + FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis  
**Rationale**:
- Python has best AI/ML ecosystem
- FastAPI provides high performance async capabilities
- PostgreSQL for reliable trade history
- Redis for real-time caching and queues

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Node.js: Rejected - weaker ML libraries
- Go: Rejected - limited LLM integration options
- MongoDB: Rejected - ACID compliance needed for financial data

### Decision 4: Risk Management Approach
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Decision**: Hard limits with automated circuit breakers  
**Rationale**:
- Protect capital during system learning phase
- Prevent catastrophic losses from bugs or market events
- Build confidence through controlled exposure

**Specific Limits**:
- 2% max risk per trade
- 5% daily loss limit
- 3 concurrent positions maximum
- No leverage initially

### Decision 5: MVP Scope
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Decision**: Start with 10 liquid stocks, expand gradually  
**Rationale**:
- Easier to monitor and debug with limited scope
- High liquidity reduces slippage risk
- Well-covered stocks have more news/social data
- Can validate system before scaling

**Expansion Plan**:
- Week 1-2: 10 stocks (FAANG + major tech)
- Week 3-4: 20 stocks (add financials, healthcare)
- Week 5-6: 50 stocks (broader S&P 500 coverage)

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 6: LLM Provider Strategy
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Decision**: Multi-provider with GPT-4 primary, Claude backup  
**Rationale**:
- Redundancy prevents single point of failure
- Different models have different strengths
- Cost optimization by routing tasks appropriately

**Model Allocation**:
- GPT-4: News analysis, complex reasoning
- Claude: Backup, validation, risk assessment
- Gemini: High-volume sentiment analysis

### Decision 7: Data Source Priority
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Decision**: News > Social > Technical indicators  
**Rationale**:
- News provides strongest causal signals
- Social media offers early momentum detection
- Technical indicators least differentiated

**Source Ranking**:
1. SEC filings (highest reliability)
2. Major news wires (Bloomberg, Reuters)
3. Company press releases
4. Reddit/Twitter (momentum signals)
5. Technical indicators (confirmation only)

### Decision 8: Execution Strategy
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Decision**: Market orders for entry, limit orders for exit  
**Rationale**:
- Speed critical for entry on breaking news
- Controlled exits protect profits
- Bracket orders provide automatic risk management

**Order Types**:
- Entry: Market order with 0.5% slippage tolerance
- Stop Loss: Stop-limit 2% below entry
- Take Profit: Limit order at predetermined targets

## Implementation Decisions

### Decision 9: Development Approach
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Decision**: Iterative with continuous paper trading  
**Rationale**:
- Validate each component before integration
- Build confidence through measurable progress
- Identify issues before risking real capital

**Phases**:
1. Individual strategy validation
2. Integration testing
3. Paper trading optimization
4. Limited live trading
5. Full deployment

### Decision 10: Performance Optimization
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Decision**: Optimize for latency over throughput  
**Rationale**:
- Speed is competitive advantage in day trading
- Better to process fewer signals faster
- Can scale horizontally if needed

**Optimization Priorities**:
1. News-to-signal latency (<30 seconds)
2. Signal-to-execution (<2 seconds)
3. Social mention detection (<1 minute)
4. System resource usage (secondary concern)

## Risk Decisions

### Decision 11: Failure Modes
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Decision**: Fail safely with position flattening  
**Rationale**:
- Protect capital above all else
- Clear recovery procedures
- Automatic position closing on critical errors

**Failure Responses**:
- API timeout: Retry 3x, then halt
- LLM error: Fall back to secondary model
- Data feed loss: Close all positions
- System crash: Flatten via broker API

### Decision 12: Compliance Approach
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Decision**: Trade only public information, no insider knowledge  
**Rationale**:
- Avoid regulatory issues
- Maintain ethical standards
- Build sustainable business model

**Compliance Rules**:
- No trading on material non-public information
- Full audit trail of all decisions
- Transparent decision-making process
- Regular compliance reviews

## Future Considerations

### Decision 13: Scaling Strategy
**Date**: 2025-08-16

**Options**:
1. Vertical scaling (more capital, same strategy)
2. Horizontal scaling (more strategies)
3. Asset class expansion (crypto, forex)
4. Institutional offering

**Next Decision Point**: After 3 months of profitable operation

### Decision 14: Machine Learning Integration
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Status**: FUTURE  
**Potential Approaches**:
- Reinforcement learning for position sizing
- Custom sentiment models
- Pattern recognition for entry/exit
- Ensemble methods for signal validation

**Prerequisites**: 6 months of trading data

### Decision 15: Business Model
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Status**: FUTURE  
**Options**:
1. Proprietary trading only
2. Signal service subscription
3. Managed accounts
4. Technology licensing

**Decision Criteria**: Regulatory requirements, capital availability, market demand
