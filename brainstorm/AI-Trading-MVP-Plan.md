## Selected Strategies for MVP

### 1. News-Based Trading (Primary Strategy)

**What This Strategy Is:**
News-based trading means buying or selling stocks immediately after important news comes out. Think of it like being the first person to act on breaking information. When a company announces something big (like buying another company, reporting surprise profits, or getting FDA approval for a drug), the stock price will move. Our AI system reads the news, understands if it's good or bad, and trades within seconds.

**Real Example:**
- 10:30 AM: Microsoft announces they're buying Discord for $15 billion
- 10:30:05 AM: Our AI reads and understands this is good for Discord (if public) and Microsoft
- 10:30:10 AM: AI buys Microsoft stock at $300
- 10:35 AM: Stock rises to $303 as more people learn about the news
- 10:35 AM: AI sells for $3 profit per share

**Why It Will Work:**
- LLM can understand complex narrative implications in seconds
- 30-90 second window before full market pricing
- Process 1000x more sources than humans

**Why It Might Fail:**
- HFT firms process news in microseconds
- Fake news and manipulation risks
- Wide spreads during volatile news events

**Key Success Factors:**
- Focus on complex news requiring interpretation
- Trade mid-cap stocks ($2-10B) that HFTs avoid
- Enter 2-5 minutes after initial spike when HFTs unwind

### 2. Gap and Go Trading (Secondary)

**What This Strategy Is:**
A "gap" happens when a stock opens at a very different price than where it closed yesterday - like a store suddenly raising prices overnight. This usually happens because important news came out after the market closed. "Gap and Go" means finding stocks that opened much higher (or lower) than yesterday's close and betting they'll keep moving in that same direction for the first 30 minutes of trading.

**Real Example:**
- Yesterday: Tesla closed at $200
- Overnight: Tesla announces record deliveries
- This morning: Tesla opens at $210 (a 5% "gap up")
- 9:30 AM: Our AI confirms the news is real and strong
- 9:35 AM: AI buys at $211 as momentum builds
- 9:50 AM: Tesla reaches $215
- 9:50 AM: AI sells for $4 profit per share

**Why It Will Work:**
- AI can qualify catalysts better than scanning services
- Overnight risk premium creates predictable patterns
- Opening auction inefficiencies exploitable

**Why It Might Fail:**
- 60% of gaps fail within first hour (the price comes back down)
- Well-known strategy with heavy competition
- Pre-market liquidity often misleading

**Key Success Factors:**
- Only trade gaps with AI-verified catalysts (score >70%)
- Exit quickly - maximum 30-minute holds
- Focus on gaps between 3-7% (sweet spot)

### 3. Social Momentum Scalping (Experimental)

**What This Strategy Is:**
This strategy watches social media (Reddit, Twitter, TikTok) for stocks that suddenly everyone is talking about. When thousands of retail traders all buy the same stock at once (like what happened with GameStop), it creates a quick price surge. We detect this surge early, ride the wave for 5-15 minutes, then get out before it crashes back down. It's like surfing - catch the wave, ride it briefly, get out before you wipe out.

**Real Example:**
- 11:00 AM: 50 people mention $BBBY on Reddit
- 11:05 AM: Suddenly 500 people are talking about it
- 11:05:30 AM: Our AI detects this 10x increase in mentions
- 11:06 AM: AI buys BBBY at $5.00
- 11:08 AM: Stock spikes to $5.25 as more people pile in
- 11:08 AM: AI sells immediately for $0.25 profit per share
- 11:15 AM: Stock crashes back to $4.80 (we're already out)

**Why It Will Work:**
- Retail coordination creates 5-15 minute predictable pumps
- Social velocity detection faster than human monitoring
- FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) psychology reliable in retail favorites

**Why It Might Fail:**
- High manipulation risk (pump & dumps - coordinated scams)
- Terrible spreads and liquidity (hard to buy/sell at good prices)
- SEC halt risk on unusual activity (trading can be stopped)

**Key Success Factors:**
- Only trade liquid stocks ($10-100 price range)
- Maximum 5-minute holds (get in and out fast)
- Avoid if >3 red flags in pump detection

### LLM Integration Workflow

#### Morning Routine (9:00 AM)
```python
# Scout Agent searches overnight news
news_items = scout.search_web([
    "site:bloomberg.com merger acquisition",
    "site:sec.gov 8-K filing",
    "site:reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets DD",
    "site:seekingalpha.com breaking"
])

# Analyst Agent processes each item
for news in news_items:
    analysis = llm.analyze(
        prompt=f"""
        Analyze this news for trading impact:
        {news.content}
        
        Return:
        1. Affected tickers
        2. Bullish/bearish/neutral
        3. Confidence score (0-100)
        4. Expected price impact %
        5. Time sensitivity (immediate/hours/days)
        """
    )
    
    if analysis.confidence > 75 and analysis.time == "immediate":
        signals.append(create_trade_signal(analysis))
```

#### Real-Time News Processing
```python
# Continuous monitoring during market hours
@websocket.on_news_alert
async def process_breaking_news(news):
    # Multi-model consensus for critical decisions
    gpt4_analysis = await gpt4.analyze(news)
    claude_analysis = await claude.analyze(news)
    
    if both_bullish_and_confident(gpt4_analysis, claude_analysis):
        trade_signal = create_consensus_signal()
        await execute_if_risk_approved(trade_signal)
```

## Risk Management Framework

### Position Sizing Formula
```python
def calculate_position_size(signal, account_balance):
    # Never risk more than 2% per trade
    max_risk = account_balance * 0.02
    
    # Adjust by confidence score
    confidence_multiplier = signal.confidence / 100
    
    # Adjust by market regime
    if vix > 25:
        regime_multiplier = 0.5
    else:
        regime_multiplier = 1.0
    
    position_risk = max_risk * confidence_multiplier * regime_multiplier
    
    # Calculate shares based on stop distance
    shares = position_risk / signal.stop_distance
    
    # Never exceed 25% of account in one position
    max_position = account_balance * 0.25
    position_value = shares * signal.entry_price
    
    if position_value > max_position:
        shares = max_position / signal.entry_price
    
    return int(shares)
```

### Circuit Breakers
```python
# Daily loss limit
if daily_pnl < -(account_balance * 0.03):
    shutdown_trading()
    send_alert("Daily loss limit reached")

# Correlation limit
if correlation_between_positions() > 0.6:
    reduce_all_positions_by_half()

# News reliability check
if news_source_reliability < 0.7:
    require_second_source()

# Unusual market conditions
if spy_down_percent > 2 in last_10_minutes:
    close_all_positions()
    enter_defensive_mode()
```

## Next Steps to Start Tomorrow

### Day 1 Action Items
1. **Create Accounts**
   - Alpaca: https://alpaca.markets (free)
   - OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com
   - NewsAPI: https://newsapi.org

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   ```bash
   mkdir ai-trading-system
   cd ai-trading-system
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install fastapi alpaca-py openai pandas numpy
   ```

3. **Create First Agent**
   ```python
   # scout.py - Minimal news scanner
   import openai
   from newsapi import NewsApiClient
   
   def find_trading_opportunities():
       news = newsapi.get_everything(q='merger acquisition')
       for article in news['articles']:
           if is_relevant(article):
               signal = analyze_with_gpt4(article)
               if signal.confidence > 75:
                   return signal
   ```

4. **Test on One Stock**
   - Monitor AAPL news for one day
   - Log all signals generated
   - Paper trade manually based on signals
   - Measure accuracy

5. **Document Everything**
   - Create trading journal
   - Log every decision
   - Track what works/fails
   - Iterate based on data

---

## Final Reality Check

**This system will likely NOT make you rich quickly.**

With €5,000 capital, realistic expectations are:
- Daily: €50-150 (not €500-1000)
- Monthly: €1,000-3,000 (before costs)
- Yearly: 50-100% return (if successful)

Success requires:
- 6+ months of development and testing
- €500/month in operating costs
- Daily monitoring and adjustment
- Continuous learning and adaptation
- Acceptance that 70% of traders fail

The edge comes from:
- AI processing more information faster
- Emotional discipline (no fear/greed)
- 24/7 operation capability
- Systematic learning from outcomes

**Remember:** Even with AI, trading is extremely difficult. Start small, test everything, and be prepared to lose your initial capital. Only trade with money you can afford to lose.
